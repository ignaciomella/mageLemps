# hyva-themes/magento2-email-module

Luma style Emails for Hyv채 Themes because currently Hyv채 does not style emails.

## What does it do?

This module reactivates the luma CSS functionality for emails in hyva-based themes.
The `email.less` file should go in your active Hyv채 theme, into the directory `web/css/`.

Note this is different from the luma-checkout or the theme-fallback modules, that actually use a Luma theme instead of Hyv채. 
 
## Installation
